This is a Python implementation of Facebook Search Tool from IntelTechniques and Sowsearch. Users can search the following types:
 - Posts
 - Photos
 - Videos
 - People
 - Events
 - User (Profile) Info
 - Generic Search

## Additional Developments
I'm planning to consolidate other social media websites (i.e., X, Instagram, and LinkedIn) into one search tool.
